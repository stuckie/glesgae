CHANGELOG
---------

7th March 2019
Added stb_ogg for OGG support
Added SoundSystem and Sound with WAV and streaming OGG support
Bit messy and could do with tidying up though, but it's a start

2nd March 2019
Added Touch support
Various malloc cleanups
Switched to "destroy" instead of "delete" for some things

27th February 2019

Updated stb_image to latest version, and removed the gcc pragmas as gnu99 compiles it cleanly anyway
Added mojoAL - https://hg.icculus.org/icculus/mojoAL/ - for audio support

25th February 2019

Various cleanups and retargeted C99 ( well, gnu99 )
Would have gone with ansi/c90 but stb_image uses C++ style comments, and would rather not modify things I don't necessarily need to

21st January 2019

Actually fixed Tiled Loader's realloc hiccup.

20th January 2019

Passthrough for blitting Textures directly - useful for Text rendering

19th January 2019

Separated File out to Buffer API so it can be used for other things.
Fixed realloc hiccup with the Tiled Loader that valgrind found.

15th January 2019

Another big update.
Added Point constructs and macros for min, max, lerp and clamp as they come in handy.
Fixed colour typo.
Accidentally set CMAKE to compile with GCC 6.x and it found some issues, so fixed them.
Realised that GAE_PLATFORM is effectively a singleton, so got rid of passing it around everywhere.
Cleaned up StateStack a bit, as it was a bit messy.. I think I had two different ideas for it.
Added a PEEK to the ArrayList

12th January 2019

Fixed logging....

10th January 2019

Nice big set of updates to make it a bit more usable.
Added animation support to Sprite via Frame-like API.
Fixed a memory bug in File from valgrind.
Fixed issue brought about by my hamfisted addition of Emscripten support.


6th January 2019

Various malloc clean-ups, though I suspect that Visual Studio Code is set to C++ mode and telling me porkies.
Initial Emscripten support.

2nd January 2019

Added mouse support for SDL 2 and fixed mouse support in general
Updated state to take entire platform struct as well as user datum
Added missing State/Timer create/delete

29th December 2018

Pulled over changes from the Arcade Badgers System version of GLESGAE.
Added comments to various functions to help figure out what they actually do.
Fixed Group so it actually works properly.
Implemented missing Double Linked List functionality.
Updated CMake files.
Removed old Makefiles.
Started on new (and working) example
Fixed VertexBuffer issues and Sprite issues ( was deleting Texture... silly.. )
Getting into a position to where it's ready to be worked on again
